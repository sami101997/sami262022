The Insert and Delete commands can be found in two places: you can find them under the Home menu in the ribbon or with a right-click of your mouse.
If you set a row height or column width to 0 (zero), what happens to the row and column? It sets to the default width or height. It asks for a new value. It hides the row or column.
It is necessary to change width and height in excel to fit the data. Excel by default provide equal width and height with respect to columns and rows. Whenever we enter a lengthy data, few characters will get displayed and other will be present inside the cell but will be hidden to the user.
Once the entire sheet is selected, you can unhide all rows by doing one of the following: Press Ctrl + Shift + 9 (the fastest way). Select Unhide from the right-click menu (the easiest way that does not require remembering anything). On the Home tab, click Format > Unhide Rows (the traditional way).
Select the cells that contain the zero (0) values that you want to hide. You can press Ctrl+1, or on the Home tab, select Format > Format Cells. Select Number > Custom. In the Type box, type 0;-0;;@, and then select OK.
On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click Conditional Formatting, point to Highlight Cells Rules, and then click Duplicate Values. Select the options that you want in the New Formatting Rule dialog box, and then click OK.
